# Personal Soccer Stats Analysis

## Background
My team competes in two leagues each year: the Burnaby Mens Soccer League (BMSL) during the Fall, and the Knight Soccer League (KSL) during the Summer. The Fall season runs from September-March, and the Summer season runs from April-August. Both leagues are divided into skill-based divisions, with Division 1 (D1) being the highest level of competition, followed by Division 2 (D2) and Division 3 (D3) respectively. In addition to the regular league matches, friendly games are also arranged throughout the year, typically between seasons. The BMSL also hosts a tournament-style cup every season, adding an extra competitive edge to the year. Although I only track basic stats, as I don't have access to my own advanced data/statistics, this project allows me to apply data analysis techniques to explore my performance across different seasons and leagues, even with a smaller dataset.

## The Data 
**Raw Data**: [raw_stats.csv](https://github.com/kiankaas/my-soccer-stats/blob/main/raw_stats.csv) <br/>
CHANGE TRACKING
I've been manually tracking my soccer stats in a Google Sheets file. This file contains a comprehensive record of every game my team has played, spanning 105 records across 9 columns. Each record represents a game, capturing key statistics like goals, assists, and match outcomes, among other details as shown below:

| Variable   | Data Type | Description | 
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Opponent | string | The name of the opposing team in the match |
| Goals      | string| Number of goals I scored during the match  |
| Assists      | string      | Number of assists I made during the match | 
| Goals_Forward      | integer      | Number of goals my team scored during the match |
| Goals_Against      | integer      | Number of goals my team conceded during the match |
| Match_Result      | string      | The outcome of the match - indicating a win, loss, or draw| 
| Season      | string      | The soccer season in which the match was played in|
| Competition      | string      | The competition in which the match was part of |
| Date      | date      | The date the match took place |

### Enhancing the Data - Historical Weather APIs
To increase the dimensionality of the dataset and explore more factors influencing game outcomes, I added two new columns: **Weather** and **Temperature**. These additions allowed me to analyze how environmental conditions might impact match performances and outcomes. These columns are described below:

| Variable   | Data Type | Description | 
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Weather | string | The weather conditions during the match |
| Temperature      | integer| The temperature in degrees Celsius during the match  |

The weather data was retrieved using the [**Visual Crossing API**](https://www.visualcrossing.com/), which allowed me to match historical weather conditions and temperatures to each game based on the **Date** column in the dataset. Since I didn’t have specific timestamps for when each game occurred, I chose to pull the weather data for 6:00 PM each day, as our games typically take place in the evening, making this a reasonable average time to reflect game conditions.

I wrote a [Python script](https://github.com/kiankaas/my-soccer-stats/blob/main/GetWeather.py) to automate the process of querying the API for weather conditions and temperature at 6:00 PM on the day of each match. The script then updated the dataset with the retrieved weather information, ensuring that both the **Weather** and **Temperature** columns were accurately populated for each record.

This enhancement provides valuable context for analyzing the impact of external factors, such as weather conditions, on match outcomes and player performance. With these additions, I arrived at my final raw dataset, which is now ready for deeper exploration and analysis.

### Data Exploration
**SQL Query**: [Data Exploration](https://github.com/kiankaas/my-soccer-stats/blob/main/01-data-exploration.sql) <br/>
Before diving into the analysis, it is essential to prepare the dataset by exploring its structure, identifying any inconsistencies, and transforming the data as needed for a better analysis. I began by uploading the dataset as a table in **BigQuery**, which allows efficient querying and data exploration. In this stage, I explored the data structure, checked for missing values, ensured consistency in data formats, and converted categorical variables into usable formats where necessary.

After running some initial queries, here are my key observations:

1. There are **5** possible outcomes for **Match_Result**: D (draw), L (loss), W (win), PKL (loss via penalty shoot-out), and PKW (win via penalty shoot-out).
2. I've played in **3 Fall seasons** and **3 Summer seasons**: Fall 21/22, 22/23, 23/24 and Sum 22, 23, 24.
3. I've participated in **5 competitions**: BMSL D3, BMSL D2, BMSL Cup, KSL D2, and Friendlies.
4. The **Min** and **Max** values for **Goals_Forward** and **Goals_Against** are 0, 9, 0, and 7 respectively. No errors here.
5. Both the **Goals** and **Assists** columns are stored as string data types because games I didn't play in are marked as 'DNP' (Did Not Play). NULL values in these columns indicate 0 goals/assists in the game.
6. My team has faced a total of 47 different **opponents**. All opponents are named consistently.
7. The **date** column is in dd-mm-yyyy format, which was converted to a date type in BigQuery.
8. The **Weather** column has 7 possible values: "**Partially cloudy**", "**Overcast**", "**Clear**", "**Overcast, Rain**", "**Rain, Partially Cloudy**", "**Rain**", and "**Snow, Rain, Overcast**". 
9. The **Min** and **Max** values of the **Temperature** column are -1 and 26 respectively. No errors here.
10. There are **no outliers** in the dataset. 

### Data Cleaning/Transformation
**SQL Query**: [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/kiankaas/my-soccer-stats/blob/main/02-data-cleaning.sql) <br/>
**Cleaned data**: [cleaned_stats.csv](https://github.com/kiankaas/my-soccer-stats/blob/main/cleaned_stats.csv) <br/>

To clean and prepare the data for analysis, I made the following transformations:

1. Removed records for games I **did not play**.
2. Added a "**Month**" column to facilitate monthly trend analysis.
3. Replaced all **NULL** values with 0.
4. Grouped **Weather** conditions into 4 categories for simplicity:
     - **Rain**: Includes any conditions that mention "Rain".
     - **Cloudy**: Includes "Partially cloudy" conditions on cooler days (10°C <= Temperature <= 15°C) , and all "Overcast" conditions.
     - **Sunny**: Includes "Clear" and "Partially cloudy" conditions on warmer days (Temperature > 15°C).
     - **Brisk**: Used for colder, clear days, including "Clear" conditions with Temperatuer < 15°C, and "Partially cloudy" conditions with Temperatuer < 10°C. 
5. Converted the **Goals**, **Assists**, and **Goals+Assists** columns to **integer** data types.

With these changes, our dataset is now organized, consistent, and ready for analysis.

### Data Encoding
**Python Script**: [link]() <br/>
To ensure meaningful analysis, categorical variables were **numerically encoded**, allowing for **correlation analysis** and structured comparisons across different conditions. The endcoding
choices were carefully designed to maintain logical consistency - **higher values indicate more challenging conditions** across all categories.  

**Competition Level** 
| Competition   | Encoded Value | Description | 
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Friendly | 1 | Least competitive (exhibition matches) |
| BMSL D3      | 2| Division 3, lowest league division  |
| BMSL Cup      | 3      | Knockout tournament with mixed opponent strength | 
| BMSL D2      | 4      | Division 2, higher level of competition |
| KSL D2      | 5      | Most competitive league (summer league with stronger teams) |

Competitions were assigned numerical values to allow for structured comparisons in performance across different leagues.

**Season Difficulty** 
| Season   | Encoded Value | Competitions Played (games played) | 
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Fall 21/22 | 1.95 | BMSL D3 (14), BMSL Cup (2), Friendly (3) |
| Sum 22      | 4.56 | KSL D2 (8), Friendly (1)  |
| Fall 22/23      | 3.80      | BMSL D2 (12), BMSL Cup (3) | 
| Sum 23      | 3.77      | KSL D2 (9), Friendly (4) |
| Fall 23/24      | 3.76      | BMSL D2 (18), BMSL Cup (2), Friendly (1) |
| Sum 24      | 5.00      | KSL D2 (5) |

To reflect the overall competition difficulty for each season, a **weighted average competition score** was computed using the formula:
**Season Score** = ( Σ (Games in Competition × Competition Score) ) ÷ ( Σ Total Games in Season )

**Match Result** 
| Match Result   | Encoded Value | Description | 
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| L | 3 | Loss |
| PKL      | 2 | Loss via penalty shoot-out  |
| D      | 1      | Draw | 
| PKW      | 1      | Win via penalty shoot-out |
| W      | 0      | Win |

Match results were encoded based on the league's point system, where teams earn 3 points for a win, 2 for a win via penalty shoot-out, 1 for a draw or a loss via penalty shoot-out, and 0 for a loss — but reversed so that higher values indicate more difficult outcomes.
This encoding maintains consistency with real-world soccer scoring while ensuring that increasing values across all encoded variables represent greater difficulty.

**Weather Conditions**
| Weather COndition   | Encoded Value | Description | 
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Sunny      | 1 | Best conditions |
| Cloudy      | 2 | Mild but playble  |
| Brisk      | 2.5      | Colder but manageable | 
| Rain      | 3      | Most difficult (wet field, low visibility) |

Weather conditions were encoded to analyze performance trends in different environments, considering factors like temperature, visibility, and field conditions.

### Correlation Matrix Analysis

To gain deeper insights into performance trends and influencing factors, I generated a **correlation matrix** using Pearson correlation coefficients. This statistical method measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, with values ranging from:

- +1: Strong positive correlation (both variables increase together)
- 0: No correlation (no linear relationship) 
-1: Strong negative correlation (one variable increases while the other decreases)
     
By examining correlations between match performance factors, I aimed to identify key trends and relationships that impact results.
The following columns were **not included** in the correlation matrix:

- **Date** – Used for time-based analysis, not relevant for correlation.
- **Opponent** – Each match is against a unique team, making direct correlations less meaningful.
- **Month** – Seasonal trends were already captured through the Season encoding.
- **Temperature** – Removed due to non-linearity, as extreme heat and cold can both negatively impact performance. Weather Condition serves as a better representation of playing conditions.

#### Key Findings
1. **Expected Findings**
- **Goals and Goal Contributions have a strong positive correlation (0.88)**
     - My offensive impact is more weighted towards scoring goals rather than assisting goals.
     - Strikers, such as myself, rely on finishing over creating chances.
- **Goals Forward and Goal Contributions have a strong positive correlation (0.72)**
     - When my team scores, I am usually involved, either by scoring or assisting.
     - I am the top scorer of the team since I joined.  
- **Goals Forward and Match Result have a moderate negative correlation (-0.58)**
     - More goals scored by the team leads to better results.
     - This confirms that attacking success directly translates into match outcomes.
- **Goals Against and Match Result have a strong positive correlation (0.68)**
     - The more goals the team concedes, the worse the match result is likely to be. 
     - This confirms that poor defensive structure worsens match outcomes, where as conceding fewer goals improves chances of winning.
- **Season and Competition have a strong positive correlation (0.70)**
     - Over time, my team has played in more difficult leagues.
     - Our team was promoted to Division 2 after our first season, where we have since played. 

2. **Surprising Observations**
- **Competition has a weak negative correlation with both Goals and Goal_Contributions (-0.19 and -0.18)**
     - As the opposition gets tougher, I am involved in fewer goals and assists.  
     - Noteably in KSL D2, my average goal contributions per game is significantly lower than in all other competitions.
- **Match Result and Goal Contributions have a moderate negative correlation (-0.38)** 
     - While expected, the correlation is not as strong as anticipated, suggesting that my individual goal contributions alone do not fully determine match success.
     - Other factors like defensive performance and team play also play a significant role in determining match success.
     - My team can still acheive good match results even if I don't contribute directly to helping the team score, meaning my teammates also play key roles in determining match success.
- **Weather and Match Result have a weak negative correlation (-0.20)** 
     - While some weather conditions may be more challenging to play in than others, they do not strongly affect match outcomes. 
     - My team performs consistently regardless of the weather. 
- **Weather has almost no correlation with Goals, Assists, and Goal Contributions (0.02, 0.01, and 0.02)** 
     - 
- **Weather and Goals Against have a weak to moderate negative correlation (-0.28)** 
     - 

3. **Interesting Patterns** 
- **Competition Level has a weak correlation with Match Result (0.25)** 
     - Despite stronger opponents, match results do not decline drastically, implying an ability to perform well in more competitive competitions.
