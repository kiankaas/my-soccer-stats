# My Soccer Stats: A Breakdown

## Introduction
Hello World! I've been passionate about soccer since I was 5 years old, playing competitively until I was 18. After a 3-year break, I returned to the pitch in 2021 and now play as a striker for Fraser Mills FC United, a Burnaby-based team. 
I never used to track my stats, but as my interest in data grew, I became fascinated with advanced statistics and the insights they can provide. I began paying close attention to tracking statistics, match scores, and trends from professional teams and players, which motivated me to start manually tracking my own performance. 
This repository serves as a mini project where I will dive into some analysis on my personal soccer stats. While it’s not meant to be a large-scale project, as my dataset only contains around 100 records of game data, I’m excited to uncover trends and patterns through the analysis of basic stats such as goals, assists, and match scores.
